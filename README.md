Project Description:
Dr. Plant is a plant disease identification website that allows users to select symptoms, providing information on the disease and how to prevent it.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Plants are tired of being misunderstood! They can't tell us what’s wrong, so we need a digital plant doctor to diagnose their problems.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A website where users can select symptoms their plant is showing, and Dr. Plant will magically tell them what's wrong and how to fix it—no more talking to plants in desperation!
